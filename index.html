<h2>Forest on Fire</h2>
<ul>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
Save the forest by using spacebar and the up-arrow key to fly and put out the fires to collect the gem while avoiding the moving flames.
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
The player should feel challenged and must learn to take their time to accompish their goal or otherwise be scorched easily. The player should feel a lot of freedom out of the movement, but nervousness from flying close to the flames.
</li>

<li><strong>Genre:</strong>
Shooter
</li>

<li><strong>Game play:</strong>
The player controls the small fairy using the arrow keys and can fly easily through the air (with some limitations). The player can shoot with spacebar to put out the flames. The player's bullets will not go through the fireballs, so they must aim carefully. Also, if the player touches a fireball, the level resets and the player loses a life so they should take their time to fly through the stage.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype goal:</strong>
Teaching the player patience and aptitude with the fairy's gravity and flying controls to best complete the level.
</li>

<li><strong>Features:</strong>
What's interesting about Forest on Fire is the fairy's flying abilities. It cannot be completely controlled, which gives the player a challenge in learning to fly carefully through the fireballs. They must learn how fast the fairy falls and how quickly she flies up to control her properly.
</li>

<li><strong>Setting/Premise:</strong>
The setting takes place in a magical forest that has caught on fire. 
</li>

<li><strong>Story:</strong>
The fairy lives in the peaceful forest, but wakes up one day to find her forest on fire! Luckily, she has the power of magic to put out the flames, but must collect the blue gem to bring the rain to the forest. 
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
Children, young teens, young adults.
</li>

<li><strong>Play time:</strong>
1-3 minutes.
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
Analyzing the stage before setting off to destroy the flames, taking your time.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
I adapted this from my pervious game, the Destroy the Targets minigame I made. However, it has siginificantly changed features. The flying and falling mechanic is similar to Flappy Bird. Source code: http://phaser.io/examples/v2/arcade-physics/platformer-tight.
